Submit form for our company website Lagooner Fishing Guides that will perform multiple task when a person fills out an information request form.

The form simply needs to have four entry fields:

1). First Name
2). Last Name
3). email Address
4). Telephone Number

The form will need to be validated to make sure that users will fill out all entry fields and that there is no HTML or Special Characters in any fields to prevent spammers/robots from utilizing the form.

The form will also need to have Google's Recaptcha installed to further prevent Robots from hijacking the form for their purposes.

Once the person clicks on the form several processes will follow:
1). An email will be sent to our company email address informing us that a someone wants some information.
2). A Thank You email will be sent to the "email Address" telling the person a little more about our services and assuring them that someone will followup soon with them.
3). A lead will be generated in our Nutshell CRM database we subscribe to.
4). A record will be written to mailChimp so that they will continue to recieve opt-in emails from time-to-time.
